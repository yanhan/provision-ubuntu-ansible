# provision-ubuntu

Provisions my Ubuntu Linux system using Ansible

## Setup

### Preliminaries

Follow the instructions here to generate an SSH key and add it to your github account:

    https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

This is for cloning the [dotfiles](https://github.com/yanhan/dotfiles) repo.

### Configuring the repository

#### ansible/roles/system/vars/main.yml

Open the `roles/system/vars/main.yml` file.

Edit the value of the `home_path` variable to the absolute path of your `$HOME`.

Edit the value of the `repo_files_path` variable to the absolute path of the `roles/system/files` folder in this repository.

Edit the `dotfiles_repo_path` variable to the absolute path of the [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/yanhan/dotfiles).

#### ansible/localhost.yml

Open the `localhost.yml` file.

Edit the value of the `user` variable to your actual username.

#### ansible/roles/system/files/password.txt

In the `ansible/roles/system/files/password.txt`, there should be a single line containing the password of your current user.

Note that this file is `.gitignore`d.

This file is necessary for installing the dotfiles; it is used for changing the shell of the current user to zsh.

## Run

```
./run
```

If the path to your home directory is different from the value of the `home_path` variable in `roles/system/vars/main.yml`, run with:

```
./run --extra-vars home_path=/path/to/your/home/dir
```
